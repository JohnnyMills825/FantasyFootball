## About This
 This is a simple statistical analysis and plotting of fantasy football data from the 2021-2022 season. The goal of this is to refresh myself on R before the semester, and primarily to see if there are any trends that I can use to potentially find a good pick for my upcoming fantasy draft. The data is based off of a PPR (Points Per Reception) league.
